## Call Center Overview 
Sure, let’s break down the key metrics from  Power BI report/dashboard:
Total Calls Received: 5000
This represents the total number of calls that came into  call center.              
Total Calls Answered: 4054
Out of the 5000 calls received, 4054 were successfully answered by your agents. This indicates a high answer rate.
Total Calls Abandoned:This can be calculated by subtracting the total calls answered from the total calls received:5000−4054=946
So, 946 calls were abandoned, meaning the callers hung up before an agent could answer.
Maximum Satisfaction Average Speed of Answer: 68 seconds
This metric shows that the average speed of answer (ASA) for calls that resulted in maximum customer satisfaction is 68 seconds. This means that calls answered within this time frame tend to have the highest satisfaction ratings.
Average Customer Satisfaction: 3.4
This is the average satisfaction score given by customers for all agents and topics. It’s typically measured on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5), where 3.4 indicates a generally positive but not outstanding level of satisfaction.
Insights and Recommendations:
High Answer Rate: With 4054 out of 5000 calls answered, call center has an answer rate of approximately 81%. This is quite good, but there’s room for improvement to reduce the number of abandoned calls.
Abandoned Calls: The 946 abandoned calls suggest that some customers are not willing to wait. Analyzing the reasons for abandonment (e.g., long wait times, call routing issues) could help in reducing this number.
Speed of Answer: The average speed of answer for maximum satisfaction is 68 seconds. This is a critical metric as it shows the importance of answering calls promptly to maintain high customer satisfaction.
Customer Satisfaction: An average satisfaction score of 3.4 indicates that while customers are generally satisfied, there is potential to enhance their experience. Focus on areas where satisfaction is lower to identify and address pain points.
